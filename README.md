# nwl
nwl is a tiny library that does some of the Wayland boilerplate, maybe even correctly.
## Should I use it?
No.
## Why not?
Because.
## Why is it here then?
So I don't have to copy paste it everywhere.
Sharing is caring.
## How do I build nwl?
Like any other Meson project.
But I strongly recommend not building nwl separately.
Instead have nwl be a subproject wherever it's needed, statically linked.
